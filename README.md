## Description

Ever needed to quickly remember that familiar face that you've been introduced to for the last year and half, but are left waiting for them to interact with someone else, so you don't have to? Well, we have just the thing for you...

Our motivation with this application is to create a central point for you to track your most personal relationships to one off acquaintances. It can be tough to juggle work, school, pets, and everything else life often tends to throw at us and then still be expected to remember birthdays and other important dates. This application makes it easy for you to store and retrieve this information in a database you create with your own account.

## Installation

Click <<< insert link to application here >>> to go to the deployed application.

If you'd like to see how the gears work behind the screens, then download the repository and do the following in the main folder's terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

You're going to want to create an account by clicking the "Get Started" button on the landing page. Here you'll need to fill out the form with the appropriate information.

Once you've finished that, you'll be brought to your Dashboard with any important dates or reminders you've created within your contact's profile page.

To create a contact, you just need to hit the [+] button in the upper left. This will bring you to a form where you can fill in any applicable information you would like to keep track of for the future. If there is a date associated with a specific field, then it will be listed on your Dashboard. As you add contacts to your account, they will begin filling out the left side of the screen. There is a search function available if your circle is becomes big enough.
